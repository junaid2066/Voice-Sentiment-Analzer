Title: Voice Emotion Detection System

Description

A comprehensive project that implements a voice emotion detection system using machine learning techniques. It processes audio data, extracts features, and trains a neural network model to classify emotions.

Features
  1. Emotion classification from audio recordings.
  2. Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques.
  3. Model training with evaluation metrics.
  4. Visualization of results with confusion matrices.
